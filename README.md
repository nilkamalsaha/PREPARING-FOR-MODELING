# PREPARING-FOR-MODELING

To prepare for modeling means to transform the data into a structure and format that can be used as a direct input for a machine learning algorithm. You can prepare your data for modeling by:

• Creating a single table

• Setting the correct row granularity

• Ensuring each column is non-null and numeric

• Engineering features for the model
